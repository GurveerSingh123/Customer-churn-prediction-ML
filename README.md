# Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. Churn refers to when customers stop using a company’s product or service. Accurately predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers.

## 📊 Objective

To build and evaluate ML models that can classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data and behavioral features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Models Trained

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- KNN
- Decision tree classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📌 Highlights

- Preprocessing of customer dataset
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- ROC-AUC curve plotted for performance insights

## 🔍 Research Questions Solved

**1**. Can we predict whether a customer will churn based on their service usage, tenure, and demographics?  
**2**. Which features contribute the most to predicting churn?  
**3**. Can the model detect at-risk customers early (e.g., within the first 3 months)?  
**4**. Can we segment customers by churn risk probability to prioritize retention campaigns?  
**5**. Can we predict churn differently for different customer segments, such as geography or senior citizens or acitivity status?
## 📁 Dataset

Contains features like `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Balance`, `EstimatedSalary`, and more. The target variable is `Churn`.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score
